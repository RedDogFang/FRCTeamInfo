#Project Name
web application for sharing FRC team info

##Example Project
https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx/tree/main/example

##Getting Started
These instructions will get your project up and running on your Windows machine for development and testing purposes.

###Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Comes installed with Python if you select the option during Python installation)
###Installing
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

###Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git Bash or Command Prompt:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://yourprojectrepository.com/project.git
cd project
Set up a Python Virtual Environment
Using the Command Prompt, navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment. This isolates your project dependencies:

Copy code
python -m venv myenv
Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment by running:

Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate //PS
$ source myenv/Scripts/activate //Bash
Your command prompt should now show the name of your virtual environment, indicating that it is active.

###Install Project Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, use pip to install the project dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install Django and any other dependencies defined in your requirements.txt file.

###Run Database Migrations
python manage.py migrate
This will perform necessary migrations for django

###Run the Development Server
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the Django development server:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
You can now access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.


##GPT explanation on folder structure
Based on your latest message, your folder structure does indeed follow the typical Django project layout. Here’s a summary of the correct structure and confirmation of your setup:

bash
Copy code
FRCTeamInfo/
│
├── manage.py              # Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks
│
├── myapp/                 # Your Django app directory
│   ├── migrations/        # Directory for database migrations files
│   ├── __init__.py        # Indicates that this directory is a Python package
│   ├── admin.py           # Configuration for the admin interface
│   ├── apps.py            # Application-specific configurations
│   ├── models.py          # Database models
│   ├── tests.py           # Test classes
│   └── views.py           # Views for handling requests
│
├── myenv/                 # Virtual environment directory
│
├── myproject/             # Django project directory
│   ├── __init__.py        # Indicates that this directory is a Python package
│   ├── asgi.py            # ASGI config for running your project
│   ├── settings.py        # Settings/configuration for this Django project
│   ├── urls.py            # The URL declarations for this Django project
│   └── wsgi.py            # WSGI config for running your project
│
├── README.md              # Project description and instructions
│
└── requirements.txt       # File listing the project’s dependencies
Given this structure:

manage.py is correctly placed at the root of your project (FRCTeamInfo/), allowing you to execute Django commands for the entire project.
myapp/ is also correctly positioned at the root, indicating it’s a component of your project. Apps are meant to be reusable, potentially in multiple projects, so they sit alongside the project configuration (myproject/), not nested within it.
myproject/ contains your project's settings and configuration, including settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, and asgi.py. This is correctly set up.
myenv/ is your Python virtual environment where project dependencies are isolated.
README.md and requirements.txt are also appropriately located at the root, serving their purpose for project documentation and dependency listing.
Conclusion:
Your project structure is set up correctly according to Django's recommended project layout. This structure supports proper separation of concerns between your project settings (myproject/), application logic (myapp/), and the environment (myenv/), while also providing clear paths for project management and dependency control.
